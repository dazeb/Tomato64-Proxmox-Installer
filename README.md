# Tomato64-Proxmox-Installer
A simple script that downloads and installs Tomato64 as a virtual machine in Proxmox.

Update: Script downloads and creates the vm but at the moment you have to go to `Hardware > Disk` on the VM and add the unused disk.

Just double click on the disk, set the size and click `ADD`.
